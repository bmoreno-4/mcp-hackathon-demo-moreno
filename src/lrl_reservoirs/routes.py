"""Custom HTTP routes for the MCP server.

These are only active when the server runs over HTTP (streamable-http). They
sit alongside the `/mcp` endpoint on the same app.

The `/health` route matters for cloud deploys: cloud.gov, IBM Code Engine, and
Databricks Apps all use an HTTP health check to decide the app started
correctly. Keep it fast and dependency-free.
